Build a flight booking system simulation app with the following requirements:

1. **Core Features**
   - Allow users to search for flights by:
     - Departure city
     - Destination city
     - Departure date
     - Return date (optional)
   - Display available flights with details:
     - Airline name
     - Flight number
     - Departure/arrival times
     - Duration
     - Price
     - Seat availability
   - Enable users to select a flight and book tickets.
   - Simulate payment confirmation (no real payment gateway, just a mock success/failure).
   - Generate a booking confirmation with a unique booking ID.

2. **Data Models**
   - **Flight**: flight number, airline, origin, destination, departure time, arrival time, duration, price, available seats.
   - **User**: name, email, phone number.
   - **Booking**: booking ID, user details, flight details, number of seats booked, booking status.

3. **Functional Requirements**
   - Search flights from a predefined dataset (mock data).
   - Validate seat availability before booking.
   - Update seat count after successful booking.
   - Store booking history for each user.
   - Provide cancellation option (restore seat count).

4. **UI/UX**
   - Simple interface with:
     - Search form
     - Flight results list
     - Booking form
     - Confirmation page
     - Booking history page
   - Use clean navigation and clear error messages.

5. **Technical Requirements**
   - Backend: Use Python (Flask/Django) or Node.js (Express).
   - Frontend: React, Angular, or simple HTML/CSS/JS.
   - Database: SQLite or MongoDB for storing flights and bookings.
   - Ensure modular code with separate layers for data, business logic, and presentation.

6. **Simulation Extras**
   - Randomly generate flight schedules for different airlines.
   - Add filters (price range, duration, airline).
   - Simulate payment gateway with random success/failure.
   - Provide sample users and preloaded bookings.

Deliverables:
- A working app that simulates searching, booking, and canceling flights.
- Mock data for flights and users.
- Documentation explaining how to run the app.
